# The-Use-of-Q-learning-for-Optimization-in-Dynamic-Environments
Q-learning algorithm is due to the combination of reinforcement learning and fuzzy logic are a good choice for solving these problems are.Our Q-learning algorithm to optimize thesis first define the dynamic environment. After the improvement of the proposed algorithm by fuzzy logic, we briefly review the results of the fuzzy reward function is proposed to reduce the complexity in dynamic environments, define algorithms were FQLO And standardized testing and the proper performance of the proposed algorithm are expressed.
